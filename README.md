# Extra Roles
A BepInEx mod for Among Us that adds 4 new roles into the game.

# Notice
This mod will work on Innersloth servers, but everybody in the lobby has to have the same version of the mod.

# Installation

Here's a quick video if you can't be bothered to read the steps: https://youtu.be/gtuqYsdir_k  
For the rest of you, here's the installation instructions.  
  
## Instructions
  
1) Download the latest release from the releases tab.
2) If you do not have WinRar, install it from here: https://www.rarlab.com/
3) Once WinRar is installed, open the .rar file you downloaded from the releases tab.
4) Go to the Among Us install directory. On Steam, right click the game, hover over manage, and click "Browse Local Files"
4) Drag every single file inside the downloaded .rar into your Among Us directory. (The folder that contains Among Us.exe)
5) Run the game. The mod will take pretty long to start the first time, but after that, it will start at about the same speed.
6) To verify the mod is installed, look at the text in the top left of the menu screen.
7) Make sure it says "Mods: 3" and "Extra Roles Mod vX.X.X Loaded." (X.X.X being the current version number)
